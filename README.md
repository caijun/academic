# My Own Academic Experience

## How to read literature
After reading a paper, you should download only those references related to your current research (e.g. influenza) rather than all references, which can make you focus on your research and avoid wasting time. There may exist some interest and influential papers related to other infectious diseases (such as measles, dengue etc.) in the reference list. It will take you lots of time to sort out those papers; however you don't have time to read them since there are already plenty of papers on influenza to read. What do you benifit from doing so? Hence the wise strategy is to just leave them alone. You would get the chance to read them again if you conduct research on such topics later.

## Don't waste time on updating softwares
Only update the softwares when necessary, such as you need to use the new features to accomplish your compuation. For some sofewares that are diffcult to install, you should get used to the old version and update it when you need to reinstall it.

## Don't waste time on collecting papers
When you following the most recent papers, you would find lots of interesting papers in other fields. You should narrow your interests and focus on the papers relevant to your current research topic (e.g., influenza). Don't waste time on downloading those papers and reading them. Focus on your current project and finish it, then you can start another new project. By completing projects one by one, finally you would find yourself have done great jobs and make rapid progress.
