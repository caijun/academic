## How To Read Literature

* After reading a paper, you should download only those references related to your current research (e.g. influenza) rather than all references, which can make you focus on your research and avoid wasting time. There may exist some interest and influential papers related to other infectious diseases (such as measles, dengue etc.) in the reference list. It will take you lots of time to sort those papers and you don't have time to read them since there are plenty of papers on influenza to read. What do you benifit from doing so? Hence the wise strategy is to just leave them alone. You would get the chance to collect them again if you conduct research on such topics later.

## Don't waste time on updating softwares
Only update the softwares when necessary, such as you need to use the new feature to accomplish the compuation. For some sofewares that are diffcult to install, you should get used to the old version and update it when you need to reinstall it.
